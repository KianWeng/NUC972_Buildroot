1. INTRODUCTION
    
    MiniGUI is a mature cross-platform windowing system and GUI (Graphics 
    User Interface) support system for real-time embedded systems. This 
    is version 3.0 released by FMSoft (http://www.minigui.com).

    MiniGUI aims to provide a fast, stable, full-featured, and cross-platform
    windowing and GUI support system, which is especially fit for 
    real-time embedded systems based-on Linux/uClinux, eCos, and other 
    tranditional RTOSes, such as VxWorks, ThreadX, Nucleus, pSOS, uC/OS-II, 
    and OSE.

    This is the MiniGUI core source tarball, which provides windowing 
    and graphics interfaces as well as a lot of standard controls. 

    Besides MiniGUI core, FMSoft also provides some components
    for the developers to develop application much easier:

    o mGi: An input method component for MiniGUI. This component provides
      some typical input methods (such as softkey, hand-writing, and predict
      text input for mobile phone) for MiniGUI applications. 

    o mGp: A printing component for MiniGUI. By using mGp, you can print
      out the graphics created by MiniGUI application to general-purpose priters.

    o mG3d: A simple three-dimension component for MiniGUI. This component
      provides a simple 3D API for application. You can use mG3d to create
      3D UI.

    o mGUtils: A MiniGUI component which contains miscellaneous utilities 
      like ColorSelectionDialogBox, FileOpenDialogBox, and so on. 

    o mGPlus: A MiniGUI component which provides support for advanced graphics 
      functions like path, gradient, anti-aliase stretch, and color combination.

    MiniGUI also is a free software project. In December 1998, the initiator of 
    FMSoft, Wei Yongming, began to develop MiniGUI under the 
    GNU General Public License (GPL). In September 2002, the core developers of 
    MiniGUI founded FMSoft and started the commercial marketing with 
    the free software. By now, FMSoft still continues to release MiniGUI 
    as a free software project.

2. THE RUNTIME MODES OF MINIGUI

    You can configure and compile MiniGUI as one of three runtime modes:

    * `MiniGUI-Threads': A program running on MiniGUI-Threads can create
      multiple cascaded windows in different threads, and all the windows
      belong to a single process. MiniGUI-Threads is fit for some real-time
      systems on Linux/uClinux, eCos, uC/OS-II, VxWorks, pSOS, ThreadX, 
      and OSE.

    * `MiniGUI-Processes': A program running on MiniGUI-Processes is 
      an independent process, which can also create multiple windows. 
      MiniGUI-Processes is fit for some complex embedded systems, such as 
      PDAs, Thin-Clients or STBs. This mode is only useful for full-featured 
      UNIX-like operating systems, like Linux.

    * `MiniGUI-Standalone': A single process version of MiniGUI. This mode
      is useful for some systems which lack of PThread support, like some 
      buggy uClinux systems.

    The original MiniGUI (version 1.0) run in MiniGUI-Threads mode.
    It is based on POSIX-compliant thread library. And this thread-based 
    architecture of MiniGUI is very fit for most traditional embedded 
    operating systems, such as eCos, uC/OS-II, and VxWorks. However, 
    if you use embedded Linux, the architecture like X Window will have 
    better stability and scalability, because of the independent memory 
    address space of every process.

    Since version 2.0, we provides a new runtime mode called MiniGUI-Processes.
    You can use MiniGUI-Processes to run more than one MiniGUI-based 
    program in the form of UNIX process at the same time. MiniGUI-Processes 
    is a full-featured multi-process version of original MiniGUI -- You 
    can run a program based on MiniGUI-Processes from a program called 
    'mginit'. Just like X Window, the former process is called a client, 
    and the latter the server. 

    Clients connect to the server via UNIX domain socket, and the server 
    receives and responses requests from clients. The server provides shared 
    resources for clients, manage window objects, and sends mouse 
    (or touch screen) and keyboard events to the active top-most client. 
    If a client exits or dies for some reasons, it will not damage other 
    clients and the server.

4. HISTORY

    About ten years have pasted since MiniGUI was initially created at 
    the end of 1998, and now it becomes much reliable and stable. 
    During the past years, many remarkable changes have taken place in 
    the MiniGUI project.

    At the original, the version 0.2.xx was based on SVGALib and PThread 
    (LinuxThreads). Then the version 0.3.xx had many enhanced features 
    including Graphics Abstract Layer (GAL), Input Abstract Layer (IAL), 
    and the support for multiple charsets and multiple fonts. 

    In version 1.0.00, we designed MiniGUI-Lite, which was more fit for 
    some complex embedded systems, such as PDAs, Thin-Clients, or STBs. 
    MiniGUI-Lite made the embedded systems more stable and efficient. 
    The version 1.0.00 provided the native fbcon engine based on Linux 
    FrameBuffer device directly as well. 

    In the development of version 1.1.00, we re-wrote the GAL and GDI 
    interfaces, and provided some advanced video features, such as raster 
    operation, transparent blitting, alpha blending, and video hardware 
    acceleration. We also provided some important GDI functions, such as 
    Ellipse, Arc, Polygon, and FloodFill.

    In the development of version 1.6.0, we added advanced 2D graphics
    functions to MiniGUI. It provides the abstract logical pen and brush
    objects, and can be used to render advanced graphics objects.

    In the development of version 2.0.x, we developed MiniGUI-Processes.

    In the development of version 3.0.x, we introduced Look & Feel Renderer,
    BIDI text support, No-rectagular window, double-buffer window, and
    other main featuers.
